# Building Fast CSV Queries

## Project Description
This project involves working with a dataset of laptops from a CSV file. The goal is to build an `Inventory` class in Python to efficiently manage and query the data. The project demonstrates how to improve the performance of data lookups by using different data structures, such as lists and dictionaries. By comparing the performance of these approaches, the project highlights the benefits of optimising data access methods for large datasets.
